### Tyepscript

Why TypeScript? Because, use of types lends itself to using highly-productive development tools and practices; such as, static checking and code refactoring during JavaScript development. Additionally, there is great support for TypeScript in the development community.

### React

Why React? Because there is no better JavaScript library for building the best user interfaces!

### GraphQL

This application was built using the [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/get-started/).
